# GANs for Fashion MNIST Image Generation

- Implemented Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) from scratch to generate fashion images using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- Developed a generator model that generates realistic fashion images from random noise vectors.
- Created a discriminator model trained to distinguish between real fashion images and fake images generated by the generator.
- Trained the GAN models using adversarial training to improve the quality of generated images.
- Implemented the training process where the generator aims to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to correctly classify real and fake images.
- Saved the trained generator model for future use and generating new fashion images on demand.
- Demonstrated the fundamental concepts of GANs, the architecture and training process of generator and discriminator models.
- Provides a foundation for further exploration and experimentation with more complex datasets and advanced GAN variations.
